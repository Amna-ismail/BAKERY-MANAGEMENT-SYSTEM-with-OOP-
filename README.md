# BAKERY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-with-OOP-
Bakery management system is a system that is especially build for providing the details and bills of bakery items like cakes, pastry and cookies on computer. This system helps the manager as well as customer to manage their ordered product easily. I used classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism and files for update and delete record.
